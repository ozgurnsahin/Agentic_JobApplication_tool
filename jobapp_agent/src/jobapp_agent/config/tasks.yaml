    - AI/ML expertise and tools (OpenAI, LangChain, etc.)
    - Data engineering technologies (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
    - Location preferences and experience level
    
    Use queries like:
    - "extract complete work experience section including all companies positions dates responsibilities technologies achievements metrics"
    - "extract complete technical skills section programming languages technologies frameworks libraries applications tools"
    - "extract complete projects section with all project names descriptions technologies tech stacks github links achievements"
    - "extract education background certifications courses degrees university details"
    Generalize the queries according to users CV.
        
    STEP 2 - CREATE PERSONALIZED SEARCH QUERIES:
    Based on the CV analysis, create 3-4 targeted job search queries that match 
    Özgür's actual skills and experience. Focus on the most relevant technologies found in the CV.
    
    STEP 3 - SEARCH FOR JOBS:
    Use duckduckgo_search tool to search for AI/ML, Data Engineering, 
    and Data Science job opportunities. 
    
    Search Criteria:
    - Job platforms: LinkedIn, Kariyer.net, Glassdoor, Indeed Turkey
    - Location: Turkey (especially Istanbul)
    - Company size: 30+ employees
    - Job posting age: Last 24 hours only 
    - Job types: Remote, Hybrid, On-site

    Search queries like:
    - "\"Data Scientist\" OR "\"AI Engineer\" OR "\"ML Engineer\" OR "\"Data Engineer\"  OR \"Machine Learning Engineer\" (junior OR mid OR senior OR lead) -manager -director site:linkedin.com Turkey"
    - "\"Data Scientist\" OR "\"AI Engineer\" OR "\"Data Engineer\" OR \"Python Developer\" (junior OR mid-level OR senior OR lead) -manager -director site:kariyer.net Istanbul"
    - "\"Data Scientist\" OR "\"AI Engineer\" OR "\"Backend Developer\" OR "\"Data Engineer\"  OR \"AI Developer\" (mid OR senior OR lead) -manager -director site:glassdoor.com Turkey"
    - "\"Data Scientist\" OR "\"AI Engineer\" OR "\"Full Stack Developer\" OR "\"Data Engineer\"  (junior OR senior OR lead) -manager -director site:indeed.com Turkey"
    
    For each job found, extract:
    - Job title and company name

    Focus on quality over quantity - return only jobs that genuinely match 
    the skills extracted from Özgür's CV.

    STEP 4 - SAVE TO DATABASE:
    After collecting all job data, use the job_database_saver tool to save 
    all found jobs to the database. Format the jobs as a JSON array.

  expected_output: >
    A structured JSON report containing:
    - List of relevant job opportunities with complete details:
      * title, company, location, salary
      * description summary
      * job posting URL and date found
    
    IMPORTANT: Format the jobs as a simple JSON array like this:
    [
      {
        "title": "AI Engineer",
        "company": "Tech Company",
        "link": "https://example.com/job",
        "description": "Job description here",
        "position": 1
      },
      {
        "title": "Data Scientist", 
        "company": "Another Company",
        "link": "https://example.com/job2",
        "description": "Another job description",
        "position": 2
      }
    ]
    
    Do NOT include metadata or nested structures - just the clean job array.
    
    Minimum 1 jobs, maximum 2 high-quality matches.
    Each job entry must include all required fields.
